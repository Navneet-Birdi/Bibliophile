## What is Bibliophile
A person who collects or has a great love of books.

## About
Bibliophile is an app to search for books, using Google Book API. This application allows you to: Search for any book and it will display list of books matching that search. And then each book displays with book's title and image. Also when you click on any book then a modal box comes up with its description like what is this book about?. And if you want to save that book you need to login first or signup if new user.

## Design
Its design is quite simple. Also no test, because there isn't much to test. The UI uses Semantic UI React which makes it look nice.

## Research and Tools
Example of Google Books API usage in Python

## Technologies Used
Reactjs, Html, Css, Graphql, Express, MongoDB

## Future Development
To have more list of categories, such as 
'Current read' and 'Will read'

To create a forum page where users can post about current upcoming events near them or activities such as bookclubs that are happening in their locations.

To create a 'donate with us', by implementing Stripe technology, we will allow users to 'donate with us' to charities or events that are related to books.
